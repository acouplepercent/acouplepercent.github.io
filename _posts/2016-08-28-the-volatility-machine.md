title: The Volatility Machine
---

Just finished reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195143302/?tag=acouplepercent-20">The Volatility Machine</a> by Pettis, here are some notes:

* Main thesis = beware of poorly-managed capital structures, esp. capital structures that have a "ratcheting" effect during times of trouble
* Some parts are quite dense; extracted some of my favorite passages below but I really recommend buying the book if this piques your interest

### Introduction
Fundamentals aren't the only thing that matter. Opinions on market structure can affect the market itself:

> I started my career believing that changed in market prices reflected genuine changes in underlying fundamental conditions quickly and efficiently. But later, like most traders, I became more concerned about the structure of the market, the nature of the investor base, the impact of liquidity and changes in volatility, and even, at some point, the sheer unpredictability and seeming irrationality of market behavior. (xiv)

Capital structure should be used as a hedge against market risks:

> A company's capital structure is the way the company funds itself and indexes its operations to market risks. The more important objectives in managing this right-hand side of the balance sheet are to protect the company from bankruptcy, from disruptions in its ability to raise financing, and from market-related disruptions in its ability to continue managing its operations. (22)

### Market structure -- illiquidity vs. insolvency

Crises that start as liquidity crises can be become solvency crises. Two ways:

1. Forced sale of assets during a market downturn
2. "Ratcheting" of increased debt payments (in real terms) due to capital structure. "This occurs, for example, when a country with short-term dollar debt is faced with a 'bank run' that puts pressure on its currency. As the currency weakens, the value of the debt increases in real terms, which causes even more pressure on the currency."

### Markets for less liquid securities

In LDCs [less developed countries] the market is biased towards short-term, volatility-seeking traders, and doesn't have a "floor" set on it by the fundamentals:

> One problem with most LDC securities markets is that there is a very poor balance of investors. Long-term investors in the United States usually ensure that US asset prices do not stray too far from some perception of underlying value, and they can usually be counted on to take on assets for the long haul if they ever become too cheap (based on their fundamental analysis of the asset). But because they cannot make the same legal or accounting assumptions about the value of stocks or bonds in foreign countries with weak regulatory frameworks and inconsistent policies toward property ownership, they cannot play the same role in LDCs. (29)

Because of this poor balance of investors, there's a "herding" effect where small technical price swings can be exacerbated by the behavior of the participants, who trade on their opinion of price movements rather than the fundamentals. This then creates a change in the fundamentals.

> It is not at all rare, then, for volatility to be initiated by a genuine change in fundamentals and then exacerbated by the behavior of the unbalanced investor group. At some point the market move can become so large that it begins to change the underlying fundamentals in a self-reinforcing way. (29-30)

### Lessons about capital flows

* "Risky structures are usually built up by risky financial practices during periods of financial tranquility--this concept is sometimes summarized as 'stability is destabilizing.'" (38)
* "A demand for money in ordinary times, and a demand for it in periods of panic, are diametrically different. The one demand is for money to be put into circulation; the other for money to be taken out of it." (38-39)

**Pay attention to capital structure when analyzing companies**: "In finance theory, a borrower's capital structure is not just the means by which it funds itself, it is also the way it indexes or controls its market risks, domestically or externally. It is a basic tenet of corporate finance theory that market risks should be managed through the capital structure." (50)

"At the extreme, it is possible to think of a company as nothing but a portfolio of instruments, all of which constitute part of the capital structure." (93)

### On credibility

LDCs frequently do the "wrong thing" due to optimism, which is hard to suppress. Imagine you are setting financial policy for an LDC. You want to issue debt, and you have two options:

1. Issue debt in local currency. This will cost you more during good times, as you'll have to pay a higher rate of interest for borrowers to accept the risk of inflation. But during bad times or currency shocks this will have a stabilizing effect, as the debt becomes smaller (in real terms) as the currency inflates.
2. Issue debt in USD (or instruments linked to USD). This will cost you less upfront, as it's indexed to a stable currency. But during bad times (as the currency devalues) the debt payments will increase commensurately, putting more pressure on the country and sending it into a tailspin.

And yet, borrowers continue to choose option (1) because it costs less at the current time, and the projections for the future are always rosy.

When market shocks happen, the whole thing collapses:

> When a low-credibility country experiences a market shock, the first reaction of investors is to withdraw from the market--thereby exacerbating the problem--until its impact can be understood. Of course this makes a long-term policy commitment difficult because without long-term backing by businesses and investors, it is very difficult for policy managers to implement reforms whose benefits accrue over a long time frame. The threat is that short-term problems--generated from inside or outside the country--can result in capital flight that derails the program before the country can receive the payoff. (109)

### On buying distressed bonds in LDCs

Old wisdom: "The best indicator of whether a country will default in the future has always been the number of times it has defaulted in the past" (165)

(Personal note: this works equally well when lending money to friends)

Hedging against default risk here is difficult due to what Pettis calls the "gapping" effect of a sovereign crisis: 

> ...by which I mean the discontinuous nature of a sovereign default--when all external debt simultaneously becomes unpayable. Because gapping risk is extremely difficult to hedge and can create tremendous inefficiencies for the borrower, investors are forced into procyclical behavior whenever there's a crisis. (164)

Any investment to dampen the cycle is helpful, but not always seen that way:

> As distasteful as it may seem, risk-loving 'vulture' investors, or short-term speculators, have a very important role in the recovery process because, by buying cheap, risky assets during the most chaotic part of the collapse, they often act as the initial stabilizers. (166)

### When it all collapses
The bankruptcy process for US corporations is a good example of an attempt to make debt servicing manageable. "An optimal bankruptcy process is not so much a liquidation proposal as it is an attempt to maximize the value of the assets by reducing the costs of bankruptcy and maintaining, if appropriate, the operational value of the entity." (176)

In other words, supporting the indebted entity and allowing it to continue operating can, in many cases, produce more value than liquidating it. Even if they're in default and *could* be liquidated, the smarter move would be to forgive some of the debt and thus maximize the value of the rest of the outstanding debt. (Though good luck getting creditors to agree to this).

> [There is] a sort of Laffer curve in which the present value of a country's debt... may be at a maximum at some level substantially below the highest possible nominal obligation. It is possible, in other words, to increase the value of the debt by reducing the nominal amount of contractual payments--debt forgiveness. (176)

### And finally

Recognize when you're in trouble. Companies and countries both seem to disregard the discounts placed on their debt, which is unwise.

"It is self-deluding to ignore the price of debt in the secondary market as an indicator of distress. Once debt trades at a steep discount in the secondary market, the relationship of investors to the borrower changes." (181)
