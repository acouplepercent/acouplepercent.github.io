title: Being Consistently Not Stupid
---

"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent." -- Munger

One way to be a better investor is to try to avoid mistakes, rather than trying to make brilliant investments. 

But how do you know if a decision is likely to be a mistake? One simple heuristic is to find some categories that are known to be difficult, and ignore them. Cut out the noise, don't pay attention to them (except maybe as a rubbernecker), and don't put any money into them.

This can be a list of sectors that have historically poor returns on capital, or sectors that are too difficult to analyze with confidence.  

My list of things to ignore is as follows:

* Airlines
* Steel and aluminum
* Solar
* Car manufacturers
* Shipping companies
* MLPs (master-limited partnerships)
* Retail (with a few exceptions for particularly strong brand or scale [AMZN, COST, TIF, etc.])
* REITs and real-estate plays

Some notes on particular sectors:

* Solar may be the future (or it may not). It's too early to tell, and the industry is unpredictable. Smarter people than me have thought they understood it, only to lose their shirts on the way down. See: Solyndra, SunEdison, and (though the jury's still out on this one) SolarCity.
* Car manufacturers: are heavily cyclical *and* capital-intensive, and it's hard to see what a real competitive advantage here is. There's some differentiation due to branding, but nothing that'll give you real pricing power.
* Shipping companies and MLPs: too difficult. They've gotten some attention from those reaching for higher yields, but reaching for yield is usually a mistake.
* REITs and real estate: know enough to know that you'd usually be the patsy at the table here.


By ignoring things that are known to cause trouble, you minimize the chances of trouble happening to you.
